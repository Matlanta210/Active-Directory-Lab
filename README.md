# Active Directory Home Lab

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we are installing and configuring an Oracle Virtual Machine and setting up Active Directory. We will be following a network diagram and using 1,000 generated users from a GitHub file, courtesy of Josh Madakor. By setting up Active Directory on our home lab and using Windows PowerShell to configure the users, we will be demonstrating a key function that organizations use as an identity provider. The key skills we will learn from this lab are Active Directory and services (DNS, DHCP), PowerShell, Windows Server, Windows networking, and virtualization of Oracle VirtualBox. Active Directory is primarily a role associated with system administrators and IT support engineers.
